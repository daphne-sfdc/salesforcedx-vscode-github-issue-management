Hello @THE_AUTHOR :wave:

It looks like you're using an outdated version of VSCode. OLD_VSCODE is no longer supported by the Salesforce Extensions for VSCode as of February 29, 2024. We highly recommend you move from OLD_VSCODE to the latest VSCode version ASAP.

Download the latest VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

After you install a supported VSCode version, run your command again and see if the VSCode upgrade resolves your issue. If the issue still persists, please provide your VSCode version and we can continue diagnosing.
